✅ What ZKTeco devices can & cannot do (REALITY)

Using ZKTeco TCP/UDP protocol (port 4370) via packages like jmrashed/zkteco:

❌ NOT supported by device firmware

You CANNOT directly ask the device:

❌ “Give attendance of specific date”

❌ “Give attendance of date range”

❌ “Give attendance of specific employee_id”

❌ “Give users created between dates”

The device does not support server-side filtering.

✅ What IS supported

The device can only do:

Operation	Supported
Get ALL users	✅
Get ALL attendance logs	✅
Set user	✅
Delete user	❌ (not supported in jmrashed/zkteco)
Clear all attendance	✅

That’s it.
